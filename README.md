Installation of reconstruction routine for P05 imaging beamline (IBL):

1) Log-in to a GPU node on the Maxwell cluster

2) Download latest MATLAB files from Github:
   
   git clone https://github.com/moosmann/matlab.git

   OR

   Update to latest version: Fetch latest version of the 'master' branch 
   from the remote repository 'origin' and reset/overwrite all local 
   changes. New files that were created locally and which do
   not exist in the latest branch are not deleted.

   git fetch origin master & git reset --hard origin/master

   Before updating you can back-up local files by branching if necessary:

   git add --all
   git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
   git branch NAME_OF_BRANCH

   To check which files were modified and which new (untracked files):
    
   git status


How to start a reconstruction:

1) Change directory to downloaded 'matlab' folder:
   
   cd matlab

2) Start MATLAB with predefined settings from within the 'matlab' folder:

   ./startmatlab.sh

    This sets environment variables in order to use a local installation of 
    the ASTRA toolbox, starts MATLAB, and sets the search path (this 
    overwrites local user settings, for details see 'startup.m'_)

    If 'startmatlab.sh' is not executable:
    chmod +x startmatlab.sh

3) Open 'p05_reco' in MATLAB located at './matlab/experiments/p05/' if not 
    already opened, eg type 'edit p05_reco' in MATLAB's command line

4) Check and modify reconstruction parameters, at least 'scan_path'

5) Start reconstruction by one of the following:
    - Type 'p05_reco' in MATLAB's command line
    - Click 'RUN' button in editor tab
    - Type 'F5' key when focus is in the 'p05_reco' file    -



How to set up automatized reconstruction loop:

1) Make a copy of 'p05_reco_template.m' and follow the instructions of the
   help within.

2) Adjust default parameter section: modify, delete, or copy parameter 
    from 'p05_reco'

3) Add data or parameter sets and run file.
