function [im, m] = MaskingDisc( im, radial_fraction, value)
% Keep central ellipse within the 'radial_fraction' of the largest ellipse
% fitting within the rectangular image and set the region outside of this
% ellipse to the mean within the disc or to 'value'.
%
% im: 2D-matrix
% radial_fraction: scalar in [0 1]. default: 0.95. defines the radius of the
% disc to be keep as a fraction of the largest ellipsis that fits within the
% rectangular image
% value : scalar or []. default: []. if [] uses the mean of disc
