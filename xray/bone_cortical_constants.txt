X-Ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients
Table 2. Material constants and composition assumed in the present evaluations for compounds and mixtures. The compositions of various human tissues was taken from ICRU Report 44 (1989). Values are given for the mean ratio of atomic number-to-mass Z/A, the mean excitation energy I, and the density œÅ. Some density values are only nominal.
